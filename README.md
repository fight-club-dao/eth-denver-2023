# HOW DO DAOS MAKE MONEY TODAY? 

We interviewed dozens of DAO members and leaders about how they earn revenue and what their struggles are. Many DAOs today are lead by volunteers and make little revenue.  Some DAOs are more focused on revenue and want to earn with their Treasury and grow their products in new markets.  In order to earn from treasury, DAOs need qualified borrowers and simple tools to manage lending and production of value.
