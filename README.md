# HOW DO DAOS MAKE MONEY TODAY? 

We interviewed dozens of DAO members and leaders about how they earn revenue and what their struggles are. Many DAOs today are lead by volunteers and make little revenue.  Some DAOs are more focused on revenue and want to earn with their Treasury.  In order to earn from treasury, DAOs need qualified borrowers and simple tools to manage lending.

# DOAs Can Lend to Qualified Brick and Mortar Businesses!

Partnering with businesses that know how to be profitable is a great first step.  In our project the lending facility is available for Event Producers.  Events and Entertainment are profibable areas of the global economy, and often these businesses produce digital goods like video and media.  They also produce the groundwork for Prediction Markets.

# Lets Review DeFi Lending to creditworthy borrowers in Traditional Businesses

FROM HUMA.FINANCE

2 notes on lending between web3 and traditional business:
<br>
<br>
<i>
Income: Income (cashflow) is the most vital signal in a wide array of underwriting scenarios, since it offers the best measure for ability to pay. The more comprehensive we can understand income, the better we can underwrite.

Receivables: Today, collateral in DeFi mainly represents a handful of digital assets. The majority of businesses and people in the world do not have tons of digital assets idling, but they do have receivables in the form of future invoices, transactions, subscription revenue, paychecks, royalties etc. In fact, in structured finance, such receivables are regularly used in the securitization of loans. Receivables are the best signal for commitment to pay, because once an entity transfers the ownership of their receivables to the lending platform, it acts as a payment guarantee. We actually think collaterals are just special forms of receivables.</i>
